<h1>Metacentrism Orientation Test</h1>
 <h3> The goal of that test is to identify your current position on the Metacentrist Plane.<br>
The test explores how you tend to act across different situations.<br>
There are no correct answers.<br>
Choose the option that best reflects what you would actually do if you were put in the described situation right now, not what you think you should generally do.<br>
It's best to go with your first reaction.
