<h1>Metacentrism Orientation Test</h1>

<form id="testForm">

<!-- Question 1 -->
<div class="question">
<p><strong>Question 1</strong><br>
You are finally home and relaxing after a difficult day.<br>
A friend calls and asks you to come over immediately. They sound distressed but can’t explain why.</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="0"> I try to reason with them and suggest postponing, because I really need rest.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="1"> I immediately agree to come, because it’s my friend.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="2"> I try to reason with them and suggest postponing, because they need to learn to solve their own problems.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="3"> I immediately agree to come, because I expect the favor to be returned in the future.</label>
</div>

<!-- Question 2 -->
<div class="question">
<p><strong>Question 2</strong><br>
You work in an electronics store.<br>
Your manager instructs you to actively push a new extended insurance policy to customers, even though it’s unnecessary for them.</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="0"> I try to sell the insurance policy as much as possible, because it increases my chances of promotion.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="1"> I push the insurance policy just hard enough not to get disciplined.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="2"> I only try to sell what actually fits the customer, because misleading people is wrong.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="3"> I don’t push the insurance policy and focus on selling other products, because it’s easier.</label>
</div>

<!-- Question 3 -->
<div class="question">
<p><strong>Question 3</strong><br>
You have a stable, low-stress job that pays enough.<br>
A former high-school friend invites you to join their startup producing a new fishing rod.<br>
You love fishing, the idea excites you, but you’d need to quit your job and accept lower pay and uncertainty for at least a year.</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="0"> I keep my current job and enjoy fishing in my free time.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="1"> I reject the idea because quitting stability feels irresponsible.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="2"> I join the startup because doing what I love matters more than income.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="3"> I join only if I see strong financial prospects for myself in the startup.</label>
</div>

<!-- Question 4 -->
<div class="question">
<p><strong>Question 4</strong><br>
You’re having dinner with friends.<br>
Someone says your former school professor was boring and useless.<br>
You personally liked that professor and found his classes meaningful.</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="0"> I let it pass and go along with the mood so the dinner stays comfortable.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="1"> I stay quiet because everyone is entitled to their own opinion.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="2"> I argue back and explain why the professor was good, because it’s unfair to talk about him that way.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="3"> I lightly push back, because others might also silently agree with me and respect me more for speaking up.</label>
</div>

<!-- Question 5 -->
<div class="question">
<p><strong>Question 5</strong><br>
You’re on a business trip in a remote foreign country.<br>
After you arrive, your boss calls and tells you that the project has been cancelled by the client.<br>
Because of the location, the next flight home is only available in a week.<br>
Your hotel and expenses are covered, and you have no work obligations.</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="0"> I treat it as a chance to rest, watch things, and enjoy food at the company’s expense.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="1"> I visit local tourist attractions and learn about the history and culture of the place.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="2"> I use the time to reflect on my life — journaling, meditating, changing habits, or doing a phone detox.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="3"> I study local businesses and try to network — if there was one client, there might be another.</label>
</div>

<!-- Question 6 -->
<div class="question">
<p><strong>Question 6</strong><br>
You’re on a bus.<br>
Two older teenagers sitting across the aisle are calling a young schoolgirl, who is sitting in front of you, offensive names.<br>
They are laughing. The girl is clearly distressed and crying.</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="0"> I ignore it, because the teenagers might get aggressive and the situation could escalate.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="1"> I don’t intervene, because it’s not my place to interfere in other people’s situations.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="2"> I step in and ask the teenagers to stop, because letting it happen feels wrong.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="3"> I calm the girl down and help her move to a seat farther away.</label>
</div>

<!-- Question 7 -->
<div class="question">
<p><strong>Question 7</strong><br>
You work in a postal office where customer requests are accepted only through a website form.<br>
An elderly man comes in and says a package he sent was never delivered.<br>
He doesn’t understand the website and has no tracking number, but he has the receipt.<br>
He asks you to help investigate.</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="0"> I politely reject the request, because I don’t want to violate procedure or complicate my life.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="1"> I explain there’s nothing I can do. Some people just don’t understand that if everyone behaved like this, the system would collapse.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="2"> I file the request on his behalf, because helping him matters more than the procedure.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="3"> It’s not my fault he can’t figure out the website. If he wants extra service, he has to pay extra.
I refer him to a friend who works nearby to solve the issue and submit the request on his behalf for a fee.</label>
</div>

<!-- Question 8 -->
<div class="question">
<p><strong>Question 8</strong><br>
You attend a weekly photography class.<br>
During a session, one participant asks the instructor whether phone cameras can be used for the final project.<br>
The instructor laughs and says, “If you think phone photos belong here, maybe this class is too advanced for you.”<br>
Several people smile. The participant looks down and stays quiet.</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="0"> I say nothing and focus on the class, waiting for the moment to pass.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="1"> I stay silent, because challenging the instructor would undermine their authority.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="2"> I say that many award-winning photos were taken on phones and that phone cameras keep improving.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="3"> I don’t say anything during the class, but later tell the participant that their question was reasonable.</label>
</div>

<!-- Question 9 -->
<div class="question">
<p><strong>Question 9</strong><br>
You agreed a year ago to help a close relative run a small family café on weekends.<br>
It’s not your main job, but they rely on you.<br>
Recently, you’ve been feeling tired and less interested, and the café is doing fine enough without you.<br>
No one forces you to stay, but leaving would clearly make things harder for them.</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="0"> I stop helping, because I need my free time back and this isn’t my responsibility anymore.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="1"> I continue helping, because I already committed and backing out would be wrong.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="2"> I talk to them and renegotiate my role so I can help in a way that works for both of us.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="3"> I keep helping as before, even though I’m unhappy, because I don’t want to strain my relationship with my relatives.</label>
</div>

<!-- Question 10 -->
<div class="question">
<p><strong>Question 10</strong><br>
You’re a freelancer.<br>
New AI tools can now automate large parts of your work.<br>
The results are cleaner but less customized.<br>
Other freelancers are using the tools, finishing projects faster, and taking more work.<br>
Clients don’t seem to notice the difference much.</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="0"> I don’t want to change my working routine and adjust for the AI tool, because I’m comfortable working the way I am.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="1"> I avoid the AI tool, because design should stay personal and handcrafted.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="2"> I learn the AI tool and combine it with my work, because resisting progress is pointless.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="3"> I use the AI tool when it helps me finish faster, even if the result is less customized.</label>
</div>

<!-- Question 11 -->
<div class="question">
<p><strong>Question 11</strong><br>
In your free time, you’ve been composing a rock opera.<br>
You’ve been working on it seriously for a while and are proud of the result, but only a few close people know about it.<br>
A friend suggests you start sharing parts of it online so more people can hear it.</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="q11" value="0"> I keep it private, because I don’t want outside opinions influencing what it’s meant to be.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q11" value="1"> I don’t share it, because dealing with posting, feedback, and promotion feels like a hassle.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q11" value="2"> I start sharing it, because I want others to hear what I’ve created.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="q11" value="3"> I start sharing it to see if it can bring me fame, opportunities, or money.</label>
